## Exploratory Data Analysis of Automobile Dataset
### Overview
This project involves conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an automobile dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights about various automobile features and their impact on price.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the IBM Developer Skills Network and contains various attributes of automobiles, including engine specifications, performance metrics, and pricing.

### Technologies Used
- Python

- Pandas

- NumPy

- Matplotlib

- Seaborn

- Jupyter Notebook
### Key Features
- Data Cleaning: Identified and addressed missing values.

- Descriptive Statistics: Calculated basic statistics and visualized distributions.

- Correlation Analysis: Explored relationships between numerical variables using Pearson correlation coefficients and p-values.

- Data Visualization: Created scatterplots, boxplots, and heatmaps to visualize data insights.

- Pivot Tables and Grouping: Analyzed average prices by different automobile characteristics (e.g., drive wheels and body style).

- Hypothesis Testing: Utilized ANOVA and chi-squared tests to evaluate variable relationships.
